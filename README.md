Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering is a branch of engineering where a program has been built using well, tested and proved engineering procedures. Its importance is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    - Development of Programming language.
    - Establishment of software engineering as a discpline.
    - The advent of structured programming.
    - The rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    - Requirement - Gathering and Documenting user's needs and system requirements.
    - Design - Creating hight level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface.
    - Implementation -  Writing code and building software according to specification
    - Testing - Conducting test for quality standard purposes
    - Deployment - Release of Software to Customer
    - Maintainance - Providin ongoing support, updates and enhancement to software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.

    - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
    - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
    - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDES simplify writing code, debugging and testing and an example is VScode while Version Control Systems(VCS) help in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members aswell as roll-backs incase of faulty in the code. Example of such VCS is Github and subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
    - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
    - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
    
    Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
    Integration Testing - Testing integration between different components or subsystems.
    System Testing - Test of entire system as a whole
    Acceptance Testing - Test against user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps craft effective prompts, be clear, specific, and concise to get a better response from the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague prompt: "Tell me about the universe."
    Clear prompt: "Explain the key theories about the origin and expansion of the universe, including the Big Bang theory, in a way that a high school student could understand."
    
    Explanation: The vague prompt is broad and leaves a lot of room for interpretation, while the clear prompt specifies the desired information, level of detail, and target audience, ensuring a more focused response from the AI.
